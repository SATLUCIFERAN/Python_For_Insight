# This is a comment in Python - it's ignored by the computer.
# It's like writing notes in your explorer's logbook to explain your steps.

# Here, 'my_favorite_number' is a variable storing the number 42.
# The '=' sign means "assign the value on the right to the variable on the left."
my_favorite_number = 42  
                        
# 'greeting' is a variable storing text.
# Text in Python is always enclosed in single or double quotes.
